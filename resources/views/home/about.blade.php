To establish these industries, different types of automatic machineries and controllers are required to buy from abroad. The process costs a lot of money as well as it's a time fraggile process also. In case of running factory, the production stops due to any malfunction in the controllers. It takes a lot of time to solve this issue, as the controller is not produced in our country and production process hampers at that particular time. To solve this issue, 5D Technology introduces its journey aiming localy creation of controllers and machinaries.";

                <h2>Our Services</h2>
                <p id="answers2">In most of the cases, automatic machineries are imported from outside of the
                    country. We are trying to develop those machineries in Bangladesh having 4 to 5 times lower cost
                    with the same functionality and stability. The working principle of our start-up can be
                    explained in the following steps:,

The working principle of our start-up can be explained in the following steps:<ol>1.	At first, we listen from the sufferer people and try to solve their industrial problem using technology.</ol><ol>2.	Then we develop a solution/prototype using the frontier technology with certain cost and criteria.</ol> <ol>3.	In the next step, we test the prototype by the user group and modify it according to the userâ€™s requirement until it succeed.</ol> <ol>4.	After obtaining proper user satisfaction the product becomes ready for marketing and we sell them in local, national or international market.</ol> <ol>5.	Our marketing policies are B2C or B2B and we develop our products through our own knowledge and expertise.</ol> ";
